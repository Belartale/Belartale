# :raising_hand_man: Welcome ![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=belartale) 

I bring order to the chaos, turn coffee into code, automate processes, constantly develop

Main technologies: JavaScript, React, Redux.

## 😄 About me 

✌️ My name is Arthur, I am 23 years old. I have been doing programming for about 1 years, trying out different libraries.

🎓I have experience in cross-platform development, creating mobile applications, working with virtual and augmented reality, machine learning (recently, by the way, I participated in Yandex Data Science competitions), and I can also make adaptive layout, create an MVC application and deploy a server. In addition, I worked closely with game engines such as Unreal Engine and Unity.

I’m currently working on my first app.
